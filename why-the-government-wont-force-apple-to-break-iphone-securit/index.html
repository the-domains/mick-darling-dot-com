The SIF will load and run from Random Access Memory and will not modify the iOS on the actual phone, the user data partition or system partition on the device's flash memory. The SIF will be coded by Apple with a unique identifier of the phone so that the SIF would only load and execute on the SUBJECT DEVICE. The SIF will be loaded via Device Firmware Upgrade ("DFU") mode, recovery mode, or other applicable mode available to the FBI. Once active on the SUBJECT DEVICE, the SIF will accomplish the three functions specified in paragraph 2. The SIF will be loaded on the SUBJECT DEVICE at either a government facility, or alternatively, at an Apple facility; if the latter, Apple shall provide the government with remote access to the SUBJECT DEVICE through a computer allowing the government to conduct passcode recovery analysis. </p></blockquote><p>There is a lot of pseudo technical detail here that is really just trying to make it seem like this new super speed auto safe cracker and content immolation defuser will only work on this one particular safe.</p><blockquote><p>If Apple determines that it can achieve the three functions stated above in paragraph 2, as well as the functionality set forth in paragraph 3, using an alternate technological means from that recommended by the government, and the government concurs, Apple may comply with this Order in that way.</p></blockquote><p>Can Apple even build this crazy thing? It is interesting that the order isn't even sure if this is possible, which means Apple hasn't made it clear if they even have the capability to create the safe cracker the government wants, or which of the three tasks, if any they can or cannot do.</p><p>But the most important part of why Apple will not be creating this anti-security device is at the very end of the order (with highlights added below by me):</p><blockquote><p>To the extent that Apple believes that compliance with <b>this Order would be</b><b>unreasonably burdensome</b>, <b>it may make an application to this Court for relief</b> within five business days of receipt of the Order.</p></blockquote><p>This is the crux of the whole order that Apple and (likely a lot of other tech companies) will be hanging their arguments on to refuse to build magic high speed safe cracking devices or software to there globally, and it is only vaguely being talked about in the press about this issue.</p><p>Tim Cook alludes to it in his <a href="http://www.apple.com/customer-letter/">Customer Letter</a>  talking about the "threat to data security" and  the "dangerous precedent" it sets.</p><p><b>The Crux</b> (aka: it is all about the money)</p><p>If the government can use the All Writs Act to require any company to build something like this super speed safe cracker that explicitly undoes all the security that is designed into their devices in the first place the burden to their brand and technology in the marketplace turns into a multi-billion dollar.  For a company the size of their present market base is plenty to say this would cut into their value as a company massively.</p><p>For a smaller company that is building an encrypted communication app, the argument on burdensomeness is that you are too small to build a hacking tool against your own security process.</p><p>Building a tamper proof safe that you have proved can be tampered with  is the biggest burden a tamper proof safe company can be placed under.  The monetary value of that burden for Apple to do this would be some significant share of its $<b>624 Billion dollar</b> value.  As much as the government wants Apple to break that, and set the precedent for other companies, I doubt they will ever pay a bill that high.</p></div></section></div><section id="Footer3col" class="Section Section--components-2 Section--footer color-bg color-title z-30 p-1 ms-p-h-2vw  colors-white colors-local " data-reactid="17"><div class="fx-1 bd-none ms-bd-r ms-bd-w-1" data-reactid="18"><div class="Group Group-heading ms-p-r-4" data-reactid="19"><div class="Site-title color-text-pop" data-reactid="20"><span data-reactid="21"><!-- react-empty: 22 --><h2 class="font-title" data-reactid="23"><a href="index.html" data-reactid="24">The Burden of Breaking Into iOS Is Huge</a></h2></span></div></div></div><div class="fx-1" data-reactid="25"><div class="Group Group--links" data-reactid="26"><div class="Group Group--links f-s-m ms-f-s-s w-s-wrap ms-w-s-nowrap" data-reactid="27"></div></div></div></section></div></div>
